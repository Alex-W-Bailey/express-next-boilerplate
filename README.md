# express-next-boilerplate

**Noteable Changes**

1) No client folder as we are only doing server-side rendering
2) server.js is probably going to have to change a bit to use more of express-session and passport


**Why this is going to be better than normal react**
1) API calls seem to be a lot easier, but there are more weird things that I still don't quite understand...
